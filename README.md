# Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance

The following is a brief description of the codes that I have written for this work.

Codes except for the ones below are also regarding L8 (or even L7), but not included in the results in our papers.


* **'eqs.nb'** : a Mathematica code used to obtain numerical values of transition probabilities in an exact way, is at **./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/Mathematica_code/**.

  **Additional Python codes** for data post-processing are at **./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/**.

* **'frag_prob.cpp'** : a simulation code to conduct Monte Carlo estimation in comparison with numerically exact values of transition probabilities at **./complete_graph/**.

* **'cABM.cpp'** : a simulation code to conduct cluster dynamics for the cluster size distribution at **./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/**.

  **Additional Python codes** to visualize the distribution of L8 or the one from empirical data are at **./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/fig_dat/**.
