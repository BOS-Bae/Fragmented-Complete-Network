# Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance

The following is a brief description of the codes that I have written for this work.

Codes except for the ones below are also regarding L8 (or even L7), but not included in the results in our papers.


* \textbf{'eqs.nb'} : a Mathematica code used to obtain numerical values of transition probabilities in an exact way, is at \textbf{./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/Mathematica_code/}.

  \textbf{Additional Python codes} for data post-processing are at \textbf{./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/}.

* \textbf{'frag_prob.cpp'} : a simulation code to conduct Monte Carlo estimation in comparison with numerically exact values of transition probabilities.

* \textbf{'cABM.cpp'} : a simulation code to conduct cluster dynamics for the cluster size distribution at \textbf{./complete_graph/}.

  \textbf{Additional Python codes} to visualize the distribution of L8 or the one from empirical data are at \textbf{./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/fig_dat/}.
