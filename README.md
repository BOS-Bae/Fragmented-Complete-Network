# Fragmented-Complete-Network

The following is a brief description of the codes that I have written.

Codes except for the ones below are also regarding L8 (or even L7), but not included in the results in our papers.

\\

* 'eqs.nb' : a Mathematica code used to obtain numerical values of transition probabilities in an exact way, is at ./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/Mathematica_code/.

  Additional Python codes for data post-processing are at ./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/.

* 'frag_prob.cpp' : a simulation code to conduct Monte Carlo estimation in comparison with numerically exact values of transition probabilities.

* 'cABM.cpp' : a simulation code to conduct cluster dynamics for the cluster size distribution.

  Additional Python codes to obtain the distribution of L8 or the one from empirical data are at ./complete_graph/L8_confi_dat/L8/fig_dat/.
